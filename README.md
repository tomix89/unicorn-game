# unicorn-game
My first ever Unity game.
I just wanted to test out some basic concepts, and how unity works.

In mayority of cases the base idea of scripts were taken from tutorals (with some degree of customization of course):

 - basic movement (without crouch):

   with added fall speed:

  - enemy basics:

 - camera control:

 - rigged player animations (from png):

 - lives (apples) counter:

 - parallax background (coming):
 
 - sound (coming):
 
 - effects (coming):
 
 - game time, best time and restart game (coming):
 
The game logic itself is my personal idea, and the art is forom my 5 year old kid.
All the art was hand drawn, scanned, cut in photo editor and imported.

The idea is the following: you need to collet 3 apples. Each apple collected allows you to jump higher and higher.\
(coming) Finally you need to collect the gem to finish the game.
