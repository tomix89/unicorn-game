# unicorn-game
My first ever Unity game.
I wanted to test out some basic concepts, and basically how unity works.

Mayority of the things are from tutorals. The game logic itself is my personal idea, and the art is forom my 5 year old kid.
All the art was hand drawn, scanned, cut in photo editor and imported.
